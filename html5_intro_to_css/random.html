        <h2>Check out the Alto's Interior Features</h2>
        <p>The interior space of the Alto R1713 has more room than you would imagine upon first seeing the camper in a teardrop position.  When the windows are expanded, the ceiling height opens to an impressive 7 ft at the center.  The body is 17 foot long and houses a king size bed, as well as an additional dining area for two that will also convert to a single bed.
        </p>
        <p>The campers come equipped with kitchens containing a sink, two burner propane stove, refrigerator and plenty of under cabinet storage.  Microwaves are an add-on if you choose to include for convenience.</p>
        <p>Toilets are included with all models, including the R1713 or you can select the R1723 with a shower attachment as well.</p>
