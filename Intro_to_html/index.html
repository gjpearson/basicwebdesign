    <h2>Great Memories and Past Reflections</h2>
    <p>Do you remember the angst and fear of learning to ride your first bike?  Maybe you felt some trepidation in settling yourself up on that seat, placing one foot on a pedal and actually making the decision to push off and see how it goes.  For me, my dad was holding underneath my banana seat to steady me while I wobbly took those first couple of pedal strides in the side yard at my family home.  Each time that bike would sway, you'd pray that you knew how to jump off in time to avoid injury.  But then, it happens.  No one's holding on and you're soaring.  It's a freedom that you had not yet experienced in your short lived life.  The freedom of the bicycle.</p>

    <p>And now, some 50 years later, my granddaughter wanted to learn how to ride her bike.  Without training wheels, of course.  And I had the sweetest opportunity with my son to hold that bicycle seat steady while she learned to take flight.  Her undeniable moment of freedom and accomplishment.</p>
