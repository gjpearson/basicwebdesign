            <h2>Man Walks on Water</h2>
            <p>It was reported late yesterday afternoon that a man was seen apparently walking on TOP of a body of water.  Eyewitnesses say that the man, who reportedly was wearing a white tunic, brown belt and strap sandals, stepped out of a boat in the middle of the Sea of Galilee and literally started walking with his feet visible.  The man's identity is unknown but others heard men shouting to "Jesus" as he stepped out.  We will keep you up-to-date on who this man is, as well as where he obtained such power.  Reported by Ima Christian. </p>

            <h2>New York Times Best Seller</h2>
            <p>The #1 best seller was revealed at a book signing today at The Good News Bookstore in Jerusalem, New York.  The Holy Bible was written by God but brought to life at the bookstore today through a reading by the Author's son, Jesus Christ.  Known for his gentle character and particularly wonderful connection with children, Jesus was very personable and full of great advice.  Look for more sightings of this dynamic duo at other bookstores worldwide.</p>

        <h3>Children Obsessed with Author's Son</h3>
        <p>In a sweet turn of events, it seems that the son of Author God cannot seem to shake his new following.  When asked about children acosting him whenever he is seen in public, Jesus simply replied, "Let the little children come to me". It appears Jesus really does love the little children, all the children of the world!</p>
