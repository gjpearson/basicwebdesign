            <h3>Breaking Stories, continued from page one</h3>
            <p>Bethlehem Fire and Rescue were called out by a 911 call reporting a possible drowning.  It turns out, Jonah Person was instead, swallowed by a large fish and not seen for three days.  At that time, the fish reportedly threw Mr. Person back up onto the shoreline, unharmed.  I don't know about you but I think something sounds fishy with this story.</p>
