            <h3>Breaking Stories, continued from page one</h3>
            <p>Bethlehem Fire and Rescue were called out by a 911 call reporting a possible drowning.  It turns out, Jonah Person was instead, swallowed by a large fish and not seen for three days.  At that time, the fish reportedly threw Mr. Person back up onto the shoreline, unharmed.  I don't know about you but I think something sounds fishy with this story.</p>

        <h3>Word on the Street</h3>
        <p>When hanging out with friends recently, one of our reporters spoke with Linus of the Peanuts gang and asked what he thought of the New York Times Best Seller.  So what are others saying? </p>

        <h3>Children Obsessed with Author's Son</h3>
        <p>In a sweet turn of events, it seems that the son of Author God cannot seem to shake his new following.  When asked about children acosting him whenever he is seen in public, Jesus simply replied, "Let the little children come to me". It appears Jesus really does love the little children, all the children of the world!</p>
